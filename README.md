Chmapsim is a simulator tool that is used to simulate the working of the entire cache in systems and to test different algorithms working on the caches.
It is a currently existing tool built not by me, I have just modified the code to improve it's hit rate.
The working and rest details can be found in the readme inside the Champsim folder.
